# Week 3 Alternative Assignment

This assignment tries to answer some fundamental questions about this course,
now that you are getting your feet wet with node and express.

Questions we'll try to answer are:

- What is a server?

  A server is a computer or software that provides services or resources to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

- Why do we need servers?

  We need servers to store and share information, host websites and applications, and manage communication between devices on a network.

- How do web pages work?

  Web pages work by being requested by a web browser from a server. The server processes the request, retrieves the necessary files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images...) and sends them back to the browser, which then interprets and displays the pg to the user.

- What is the difference between HTML and JSON?

  HTML is used to structure and display content on web pgs, while JSON is used to store and exchange data between servers and web applications.

- What is JSON good for?

  JSON is good for storing and sharing data between servers and web applications because it's easy to read, write, and work with across different programming languages.
