1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.

Middleware in an Express application acts as a bridge between the incoming requests
and the responses sent back. It's a series of functions that have access to the request
 object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
Middleware can perform tasks like logging, authentication, data parsing, error handling, ... 
before passing the request to the next middleware function or route handler. 
This helps in modularizing the application, making it easier to manage and maintain.


Middleware is a way of breaking down the application code into small,
manageable pieces. Consequently, the code can be easily reused for common tasks,
reducing code duplication and making maintenance easier.

3.You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
    3.1. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
     We use dotev package. and put the varable in the .env file and use process.env
     3.2. How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository?
     we add the .env in the  .gitignore file.
